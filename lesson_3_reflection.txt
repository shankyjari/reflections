When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

This way, it is handy on different computers. Also, if the repo is online, it can be shared 
between different developers. This way, a team of people can work on a same repo. Which will 
be difficult if the whole code repo is on local machine only

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 Pulling changes manually, will gives the choice fo when to pull changes and 
 also, which branches to pull. The user can ignore the unnecessary changes to download.
 This way, it will be more efficient. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

The fork is being used for copying any repository from one github account to another github account.
Clone is used for cloning the git repo from github to the local machine.
Branches are used to diverge the development in a git. Like diverging frommain development.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

The benifit in this situation is that, at the time of commit,  git can compare the local copy with new commit. 
And fortunately if no merge conflict happens. Git can merge it successfully. Instead, of accessing network, when network is not available.
In which case, the merging will failed.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

I will choose another collobration tool. Probably like google doc or something else. 
Maintaining whole  code base would  be difficult. However basic operations would become easier in google docs.
But it is very difficult to maintain whole code using google docs as a repository. 


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
